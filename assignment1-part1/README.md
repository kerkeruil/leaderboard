# Leaderboards for Assignment 1 - Part 1
This directory contains one leaderboard table for each method run in the assignment.
Click one of the markdown files listed above to see the corresponding leaderboard. For example, [BM25_1.md](BM25_1.md)

If you cannot find your team name in the tables, check the `known_teams.txt` file.
- If your team is not listed in `known_teams.txt`, please create a private issue on Piazza letting us know that your team needs to be added
- If your team is listed in `known_teams.txt`, this means we did not find any `.trec` files in your repository when the leaderboard was last updated. You can find the time of the last update in `last_updated.txt`
